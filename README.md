# Purpose

This is a sandbox for me to learn how to check if the objects inside an array of objects already exists in a second array of objects.
If it exists in the second array then I won't add the object.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
